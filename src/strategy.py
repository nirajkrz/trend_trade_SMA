    Daily end-of-day signals using SMA50/SMA250 on TQQQ.

    Semantics (long/cash):
    - BUY/HOLD (+1): when Close > SMA250 and SMA50 >= SMA250 (uptrend confirmation)
    - EXIT/CASH (0): when trend weakens as price moves toward SMA250, defined as
        distance = (Close - SMA250)/SMA250 â‰¤ proximity (default 7%) AND
        distance is shrinking vs 5 trading days ago.
    - Otherwise stay in CASH (0).

    Notes:
    - Signals are evaluated on daily Close (EOD decision) and applied next close-to-close in the backtest.
    - This implementation is long/cash only (no short allocation to SQQQ).
